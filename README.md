# Cocket Nova Getting Started Guide

The Cocket Nova Getting Started Guide is an instructional manual for utilizing the compiler SDCC. 
It serves various purposes, allowing users to explore different features and obtain new projects and 
configurations. The Cocket Nova CH552 boards are incredibly easy to use. The projects focus on innovation 
and present various alternatives for usage.

The CH552, characterized by its compact size, native USB connectivity, and 16 KB memory (with 14 KB usable),
enables the creation of simple yet effective programs. This allows for greater control in implementing various
applications. The choice of this microcontroller is based on its affordability, ease of connection, and compatibility with various operating systems.
